Programming Task
Your task is to create a patient registry. This task is to be completed at home. You will be asked to come to
the Aasandha office to:
• Explain your code of the patient registry to one of our developers (approx. 15 minutes).
• Make minor changes to the code (approx. 15 minutes).
For your patient registry task, create the following two components:
1. The Backend:
o Should be developed as a REST API using PHP and the Laravel framework.
2. The Frontend:
o Preferred to be developed as a VueJS Single Page Application (SPA).

Patient Registry Features
1. Create, Read (list and show), Update and Delete (CRUD) patients. Include the following fields:
Name, Date of Birth (DOB), National ID, and Address.
2. CRUD addresses. Addresses should not be repeated in the patients table and must have a separate
table with proper relationships in Laravel.
3. Islands must also be in a separate table. You are not required to make CRUD endpoints for Islands,
but ensure to create the proper database constraints and Laravel Eloquent relationships.
